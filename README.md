This repo is intended to show a method to implement logistic regression from scratch in c++, the algorithm pseudo-code followed is shown in the file pseudocode.png

In order to compile the files, this command would suffices : g++ *.cpp
an executable would be built named as a.out that you should execute in you command line to view the results of logistic regression applied to the dataset binary2.csv
